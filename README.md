# Portfolio Project
### Front-end Portfolio Website made up of two pages featuring my past experience, projects and interactivity with Javascript

The project was made out of accessible HTML 5 (with use of ARIA attributes), pure CSS 3 (no frameworks or libraries) and vanilla Javascript with DOM access. The website is responsive for mobile phones (320px, 375px and 480px), tablets (768px), Laptops (1024px) and computers (1440px). If you want to help with the project, feel free to directly make a pull request or post an issue.
